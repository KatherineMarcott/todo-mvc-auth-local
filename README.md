# Features to Implement

## Pomodoro
- [X] Timer, start/stop -2 people

## Extra functionality for todos

## Longer term goals
- [ ] finished pomos being tracked per task/per user - maybe a box where pomodoro icons appear for every pomo you complete. Then a click and drag to add a pomo to the task. Could be rewarding.
